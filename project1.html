    Expanding human populace and innovative improvement has prompt increment in flame 
    mishaps and dangers. Unavoidable conditions and physical constraints of person make fire 
    extinguishing a testing and demanding assignment. Fire extinguishing is an exceptionally unsafe 
    undertaking and it might likewise include death toll. Robotics is the rising answer to ensure the 
    safety of the surroundings and human lives. Fire extinguishing robot is an equipment model which 
    can be utilized for extinguishing the fire amid flame mischances. It can decrease the blunders and 
    constraints confronted by the people during the extinguishing process.
