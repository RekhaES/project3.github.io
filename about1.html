        in programming language such as Core Java(J2SE), SQL,as well as problem-
        solving skills that I'm eager to apply in real-world scenarios.

        on my career, I am open to opportunities that will allow me to further develop
        my skills, contribute to innovative projects, and work with a dynamic team of
        professionals. I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated with 
        the latest trends in technology.
